## SUMMARY

## PCB
  ### Overview
  ![PCB overview](./readme_dependencies/PCBoverview.png)
  
  The PCB looks nasty, but is more simple than it appears, at first.

  ### Where Was it Milled?
  Just as some general background, the board was milled and cut out at the BYU Electrical Engineering Experiential Learning Center. At the time of manufacture, they had yet to integrate solder masks. So, any pictures given of the fully-assembled board will show only *bare copper*. Future iterations should have a solder mask for safety reasons.

  ### Tension Relief Holes

  Probably the most striking thing to see, at first, are the tension relief holes. You thread the wires or ribbon cables through them like a needle and thread. This makes it so that the tension of any motion / movement on the wires from the outside is transfered to the board instead of the connectors. This adds durability to the board, but also makes it so that it's more complicated to manufacture. Luckily, the BYU Electrical Engineering Experiential Learning Center was able to mill it with little issue.
